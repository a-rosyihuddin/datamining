Prediksi yang dibuat oleh setiap model kemudian digabungkan menggunakan statistik sederhana, seperti voting atau rata-rata.\n","## Boosting\n","Boosting adalah variasi bagging, di mana setiap model individu dibangun secara berurutan, mengulangi yang sebelumnya. Dalam prosesnya, setiap titik data yang salah diklasifikasikan oleh model sebelumnya ditekankan dalam model berikutnya. Hal ini dilakukan untuk meningkatkan akurasi model secara keseluruhan.\n","## Stacking\n","Stacking melibatkan pemasangan banyak jenis model yang berbeda pada data yang sama dan menggunakan model lain
